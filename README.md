# Marine Rust SDK

[![crates.io version](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/marine-rs-sdk?color=green)](https://crates.io/crates/marine-rs-sdk)

This SDK empowers developers to create general-purpose Wasm modules and combine them in a multi-module setup with the help of [interface-types](https://github.com/WebAssembly/interface-types) and a [shared-nothing linking](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/blog/how-and-why-to-link-webassembly-modules/) scheme. The SDK provides all necessary macros and other features to make Wasm developing process as close as possible to the one with the "vanilla" Rust. Compiled modules are intended to run with the [Marine](https://github.com/fluencelabs/marine) runtime.


## Usage

The core component of the SDK is the `#[marine]` macro that should be used with export functions, external blocks, and structures. Let's consider a simple scenario with a module with one export function:
```rust
use marine_rs_sdk::marine;

#[marine]
pub fn greeting(name: String) -> String {
    format!("Hi, {}", name)
}
```
This code imports the Marine SDK and wraps the greeting function with the `#[marine]` macro. Every function wrapped in such way will be exported from a compiled Wasm module.

To compile this code to Wasm, you need the Marine CLI tool. If you haven't installed the cli already, use `cargo install marine`:

```bash
marine build --release
```

Finally, you obtain a build manifest embedded into a Wasm binary and can interact with a module in the Marine REPL (mrepl). If you don't have it, install it with `cargo install mrepl`:

```bash
> marine info ./target/wasm32-wasi/release/greeting.wasm
it version:  0.23.1
sdk version: 0.7.0

## SDK components

The SDK exports the following major components:
- `#[marine]` procedure macro that can be applied to
    - [function](https://fluence.dev/docs/marine-book/marine-rust-sdk/developing/export-functions) making it export from a module
    - [external block](https://fluence.dev/docs/marine-book/marine-rust-sdk/developing/import-functions) making it imported from a module in a Marine-suitable way
    - [structure](https://fluence.dev/docs/marine-book/marine-rust-sdk/developing/structures), making it usable as an argument of an export or an import function
- [call parameters interface](https://fluence.dev/docs/marine-book/marine-rust-sdk/developing/call-parameters) intended to provide a set of module start parameters
- [mounted binaries interface](https://fluence.dev/docs/marine-book/marine-rust-sdk/developing/mounted-binaries) that can be used to call a CLI tool
- [module_manifest](https://fluence.dev/docs/marine-book/marine-rust-sdk/developing/module-manifest) macro intended to embed some info into a compiled Wasm
- [logging stuff](https://fluence.dev/docs/marine-book/marine-rust-sdk/developing/logging) that allows adjusting a Marine logging mechanism


## Supported Rust types

At the moment, the `#[marine]` macro allows the following Rust types as an argument of export and import functions or the field of a structure:
- one of the following Rust basic types: `bool`, `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64`, `f32`, `f64`
- strings `String`, `&str`
- a vector of elements of the above types
- a vector composed of vectors of the above type, where recursion is acceptable, e.g., the type `Vec<Vec<Vec<u8>>>` is permissible
- a reference of all of the above types
- a structure where all fields are of the basic Rust types
- a structure where all fields are of the above types or other structures build with such a way
